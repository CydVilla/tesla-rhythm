/**
 * Analytics domain types.
 *
 * These describe the anonymous, gameplay-only telemetry that powers the metrics
 * dashboard and the autonomous self-improvement loop. Nothing here is tied to a
 * real identity: `clientId` is a random per-device id that lives only in the
 * browser's localStorage and can be cleared at any time from the dashboard.
 *
 * Framework-agnostic on purpose (no React / DOM / Node imports) so the same
 * types are shared by the client capture code, the API routes, the dashboard,
 * and the offline analysis script.
