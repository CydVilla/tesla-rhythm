/**
 * Track catalog.
 *
 * This is the open-source "song library". Contributors add new playable tracks
 * by appending an entry to `builtInTracks` below (see CONTRIBUTING.md and
 * docs/trackCatalog.md). Because we do not host copyrighted audio, built-in
 * tracks ship WITHOUT audio and play in silent/demo mode — the chart scrolls on
 * the internal clock. A track may optionally carry an `audioUrl` (e.g. a
 * user-uploaded blob URL added at runtime).
 *
 * Each track exposes a `build()` that returns the internal RhythmChart. Built-in
 * tracks build their chart lazily (via the demo chart or the deterministic
 * automapper) so we don't hold dozens of charts in memory up front.
