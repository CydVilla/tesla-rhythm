/**
 * Placeholder automapper.
 *
 * This is intentionally NOT machine learning. It generates a deterministic,
 * "musical-ish" chart on a fixed BPM grid so the game is playable immediately.
 * The real pipeline (BPM detection, onset analysis, stem separation, etc.) is
 * described in docs/aiChartGenerationPlan.md and will eventually replace this
 * function while keeping the same RhythmChart output shape.
 *
 * Design goals:
 *  - Deterministic for a given (duration, difficulty, bpm) so charts are
 *    reproducible and testable.
 *  - Never spam the same lane repeatedly (unplayable on a touchscreen).
 *  - Density scales with difficulty.
