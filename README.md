# Slop Hero 🎵

A touchscreen rhythm game for the **Tesla in-car browser**. It is a Clone Hero /
Rock Band–style game adapted for a large touchscreen: **tap-only**, five big
lanes, a vertical falling-note highway, and a hit zone at the bottom. Upload any
song and get an instantly playable chart.

Open source under the [MIT License](./LICENSE) — contributions (especially new
catalog tracks!) are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Features

- 🎮 Playable vertical slice: works with zero setup.
- 🎲 **Play random** picks a track from the catalog each time.
- 🗂️ **Track catalog** (`/catalog`) lists every track and who contributed it.
- 🎼 Upload audio → auto-generated chart. Two generators: **Auto-analyze**
  (real onset/tempo detection in a Web Worker) or a **Simple BPM grid**.
- 🔎 **Search YouTube** from inside the app (optional — needs an API key, see
  below) and pick a result instead of pasting a link. Falls back to pasting a
  link when search isn't configured.
- 🎸 **Clone Hero import**: drop a `.sng`, a `.zip` song folder, an unzipped
  **song folder** (drag-and-drop or "Choose folder"), or a bare `.chart` /
  `.mid` and play it on the touchscreen.
- ⏱️ Web Audio API as the timing source (precise, monotonic clock).
- 🎯 Five lanes (green/red/yellow/blue/orange), large touch targets.
- 🟢 Hit windows: Perfect ±35ms, Great ±70ms, Good ±110ms.
- 🔢 Score, combo, max combo, accuracy, and per-rating counts with combo
  multipliers (×1 / ×2 / ×3 / ×4).
- 🎚️ Calibration offset control for audio/input sync (−10 / +10 / reset).
- 🖱️⌨️📱 Mouse, touch (Pointer Events), and keyboard (A/S/D/F/G + Space).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>.

### Optional: enable in-app YouTube search

The Upload screen can search YouTube directly so users don't have to paste a
link. This uses the **YouTube Data API v3**, which needs an API key. The key is
kept server-side (it's never shipped to the browser) and used by the
`/api/youtube/search` route.

1. Create an API key in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   and enable the **YouTube Data API v3**.
2. Add it to `.env.local` (or your deployment's environment variables):

   ```bash
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

Without a key, search is disabled gracefully and the UI falls back to the
paste-a-link flow — nothing breaks.

- `/` — landing page (Play random / Browse catalog / Upload song).
- `/play` — the game (falls back to a random catalog track in silent mode).
- `/catalog` — browse all tracks and their contributors; play any of them.
- `/upload` — upload audio, pick difficulty + BPM, credit yourself, generate a chart.
- `/editor` — read-only chart viewer (full editor is a future iteration).

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev        # start dev server
npm run build      # production build
npm run start      # serve production build
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint       # next lint
```

## How to play

1. Open `/play` (or pick a track from `/catalog`, or upload a song first).
2. Press **Start** (or **Space**).
3. **Tap the note itself** — touch its lane on the highway the moment the gem
   reaches the hit line. Each finger taps its own note, so chords work.
   - Desktop: keys **A S D F G** map to the five lanes.
4. If notes feel early/late, nudge the **Calibration** offset.

## How upload & auto-charting works

The whole pipeline runs **in your browser** — nothing is uploaded to a server:

1. You pick an audio file. We create a `blob:` object URL for playback and read
   its metadata (name, size, MIME type), then probe its **duration** with a
   hidden `<audio>` element.
2. You choose a **chart source**, **difficulty**, and **BPM** (default 120), and
   optionally your name for the catalog.
3. The chart is generated as a `RhythmChart`:
   - **Auto-analyze audio (beta)** — decodes the file with `decodeAudioData`,
     downmixes to mono, and runs real DSP in a **Web Worker**
     (`src/game/audioAnalysis.ts`): a Hann-windowed FFT → **spectral-flux onset
     detection** → adaptive peak picking → **tempo estimate** (autocorrelation) →
     difficulty-aware selection and brightness-based lane assignment. Notes land
     on actual musical onsets. A progress bar shows analysis status. If decoding
     fails or too few onsets are found, it **falls back to the grid**.
   - **Simple BPM grid** — the deterministic `src/game/autoMapper.ts`: walks
     beats at a per-difficulty step, places notes with a per-difficulty fill
     probability, avoids same-lane repeats / awkward jumps, and adds occasional
     chords on harder difficulties. Seeded from duration + difficulty + BPM.
4. The track is added to the **catalog** for this session (with your name) and
   `/play` opens, syncing the chart to the audio via `AudioContext.currentTime`.

Auto-analyze is the first step of the real pipeline. Heavier server-side
analysis and stem separation are planned; see `docs/aiChartGenerationPlan.md`.

### Importing Clone Hero charts

Clone Hero import **is supported**. On `/upload`, drop a **`.sng`** package, a
song-folder **`.zip`** (containing `song.ini` + `notes.chart`/`notes.mid` +
audio), an **unzipped song folder** (drag the folder onto the dropzone, or use
**Choose folder**), or a bare **`.chart`** / **`.mid`** file. The app:

1. Unpacks in the browser — `fflate` for `.zip`, a built-in SNGPKG reader for
   `.sng` (`src/game/sngParser.ts`, including the XOR de-masking), or direct
   reads for a dropped folder — and finds the metadata, chart, and audio. For
   folders it scopes to the directory holding `notes.chart`/`notes.mid`, so
   dragging a parent folder still resolves to one song + its matching audio.
2. Parses metadata + which difficulties exist (`src/game/cloneHeroParser.ts`).
3. Lets you pick a difficulty, then converts the 5 frets → 5 lanes into a
   `RhythmChart`. If the song has audio (incl. `song.opus`) it plays with sound;
   otherwise it plays in silent mode.

Adaptations for touch: sustains import as taps, chords are capped at 2 notes, and
HOPO/forced/tap/star-power flags are dropped. Details and remaining work:
`docs/cloneHeroImportPlan.md`.

## Architecture

The codebase keeps **pure game logic separate from React** so the rules are
testable and the UI stays thin.

### Design principles

- **Timing source of truth** is `AudioContext.currentTime` (see
  `useAudioEngine`). Works in both audio mode and silent/demo mode.
- **No React re-renders in the animation loop.** The canvas reads per-note
  state, feedback, and lane flashes from **refs**; React state is reserved for
  low-frequency UI (score, phase, calibration).
- **Pure rules.** `scoring.ts` and `timing.ts` are deterministic functions of
  their inputs — easy to unit test (find hittable note, rating for error, mark
  missed notes, apply hit/miss, accuracy).
- **Stable output contract.** The grid automapper, the audio analyzer, and the
  (future) Clone Hero importer all produce the same `RhythmChart` JSON the game
  consumes — so generators can be swapped without touching gameplay.
- **Heavy work off the main thread.** Audio analysis (FFT/onset detection) runs
  in a Web Worker; PCM is *transferred* (not copied) to keep the UI responsive.

## Calibration explained

`effectiveNoteTime = note.timeMs + chart.offsetMs − calibrationOffsetMs`

A **positive** calibration offset judges notes *later* (compensates for tapping
early / audio output latency). The calibration panel shows live song time vs.
the offset-adjusted chart time for debugging.

## Contributing

This project is open source (MIT). The most welcome contribution is **adding a
track to the catalog** — no audio file needed. Edit `src/data/tracks.ts`, run the
dev server, check `/catalog`, and open a PR.

- Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, conventions, and the track
  data model (also documented in `docs/trackCatalog.md`).
- File issues with the **Bug report**, **Feature request**, or **Track
  submission** forms under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
- Please don't commit copyrighted audio — built-in tracks play in silent/demo
  mode.

## Not built yet (intentionally)

Server-side ML audio analysis, stem separation, multi-stem mixing, accounts,
payments, a persistent online song library, copyrighted-song hosting, and native
Tesla integration. (Client-side onset/tempo analysis **and** Clone Hero import —
`.sng` / `.zip` / `.chart` / `.mid` — **are** built; see above.) See `docs/` for
the plans:

- `docs/aiChartGenerationPlan.md` — real chart generation pipeline.
- `docs/serverSideAudioAnalysis.md` — where heavy DSP/ML should run.
- `docs/cloneHeroImportPlan.md` — Clone Hero import (incl. current behavior).
- `docs/trackCatalog.md` — catalog data model & how to add tracks.
